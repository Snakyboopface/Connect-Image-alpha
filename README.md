# Connect-Image-alpha
With this addon you can easily connect the 'Alpha' of image textures to the principled BSDF shader node for all active materials within a selected collection, will prioritise connecting image nodes labelled: 'alpha', 'base color', 'base colour', 'color', or 'colour'. Case does not matter so a node could be labeled 'aLpHA' and it will still work.
